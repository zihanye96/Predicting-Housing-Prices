# Predicting Home Prices Using Machine Learning Techniques

The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately predicts sale prices for residential homes for a Kaggle competition called "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". The dataset for this competition contains information on 1,460 residential homes with variables such as overall square footage, basement quality, and the type of exterior covering on the house. After data cleaning and feature engineering, I built GAM, regression tree, random forest, and neural network models and compared their relative performance using 5-fold cross validation with RMSE. The model submitted to Kaggle ranked in the top 30\% of submissions at the time of submission.  


The [report](report.md) discusses the project in more detail. This project was done in collaboration with Sohum Patnaik at Williams College. [More information on the competition here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
